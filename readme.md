Pico-ETH-CH9121

Quick script to get the Wave Share Pico-ETH-CH9121 working

I spent ages trying to get this thing to work. Hopfully this will save someone save some time.\
Pico-ETH-CH9121_setup_and_UDP_TX.py is a working script that transmitts "hello world" over UDP.
RX_TX_UDP.py echos incoming UDP messages.
