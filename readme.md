Quick script to get the Wave Share Pico-ETH-CH9121 working

I spent ages trying to get this thing to work. Possibly more a reflection of my programing sckills then anything else. But hopfully this will save someone save some time.\
\
Pico-ETH-CH9121_setup_and_UDP_TX.py transmitts "hello world" over UDP.\
RX_TX_UDP.py echos incoming UDP messages.
